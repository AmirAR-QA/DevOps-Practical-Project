## Brief 

I have been tasked with creating a web app which is made up for 4 interconnected services, and then testing, deploying, and configuring the app in an automated environment with a complete CI/CD Pipeline. This will showcase my knowledge and understanding of the programs that we've discussed so far, as well as showcasing my ability to use them effectively. 

## Listed Project Requirements

* A Kanban board tech) with full expansion on tasks needed to complete the project.
* This could also provide a record of any issues or risks that you faced creating your project.
* An Application fully integrated using the Feature-Branch model into a Version Control System which will subsequently be built through a CI server and deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine.
* If a change is made to a code base, then Webhooks should be used so that Jenkins recreates and redeploys the changed application
* The project must follow the Service-oriented architecture that has been asked for.
* The project must be deployed using containerisation and an orchestration tool.
* As part of the project, you need to create an Ansible Playbook that will provision the environment that your application needs to run.
* The project must make use of a reverse proxy to make your application accessible to the user.
