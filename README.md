## Brief 

I have been tasked with creating a web app which is made up for 4 interconnected services, and then testing, deploying, and configuring the app in an automated environment with a complete CI/CD Pipeline. This will showcase my knowledge and understanding of the programs that we've discussed so far, as well as showcasing my ability to use them effectively. 

## Listed Project Requirements

* A Kanban board tech) with full expansion on tasks needed to complete the project.
* This could also provide a record of any issues or risks that you faced creating your project.
* An Application fully integrated using the Feature-Branch model into a Version Control System which will subsequently be built through a CI server and deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine.
* If a change is made to a code base, then Webhooks should be used so that Jenkins recreates and redeploys the changed application
* The project must follow the Service-oriented architecture that has been asked for.
* The project must be deployed using containerisation and an orchestration tool.
* As part of the project, you need to create an Ansible Playbook that will provision the environment that your application needs to run.
* The project must make use of a reverse proxy to make your application accessible to the user.

## Created With

* Visual Studio Code - IDE
* GCP - Database and instance host
* MySQL - Database language
* Jenkins - CI pipeline
* Git - Version control
* GitHub - Repository and version control
* Trello - Project management
* Pytest - Unit testing
* Ansible - Load balancer
* Nginx - Reverse Proxy
* Docker (Compose, Swarm) - Containers to deploy to
* Draw.io - ERD creation

## Layout

To satisfy the requirements of this project I created an app with generates a random encounter, a random location, and an outcome based on the counter In more detail:

Service 1: Front-end of the program, displays all the information by requesting it from the other services.
Service 2: Generates a random encounter
Service 3: Generates a random location
Service 4: Generates an outcome of the random encounter from service 2, then sends the information to service 1 by a POST request

Docker and Docker-Compose used to containerise the images and builds
Docker Swarm spreads the app across worker nodes and a manager node
Nginx acts as a reverse proxy load balancer so no one node gets overloaded
Testing takes place in the automated Jenkins environment
Ansible configures the docker and nginx functionalities
Jenkins deploys the app
